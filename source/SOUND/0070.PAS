납  20( 0) 22    Sample Name.  Should be padded with nulls for the full
납                 length of it after the sample name.
납  42(22)  2    Sample Length.  Stored as an Amiga word which needs to be
납                 swapped on an IBM.  This word needs to be multiplied by
납                 two to get the real length.  If the initial length is
납                 greater than 8000h, then the sample is greater than 64k.
납  44(24)  1    Sample Finetune Byte.  This byte is the finetune value for the
납                 sample.  The upper four bits should be zeroed out.  The
납                 lower four are the fine tune value.

납  45(25)  1    Sample Volume.  The rangle is always 0-64.
납  46(26)  2    Sample Repeat.  Stored as an Amiga word.  Multiply this by
납                 two and add it to the beginning offset of the sample to get
납                 the repeat point.
납  48(28)  2    Sample Repeat Length.  Stored as an Amiga word.  Multiply this
납                 by two to get the Repeat Length.
